## Overview
#### Predation influences internal and external phenotypic variation across taxa. Brain size experiences high levels of variation both within and between species, and recent investigations consider predation's role in this variation. A larger brain size in high-predation habitats could influence the ability to thwart a predator while still maintaining social and survival task functioning; likewise, large brains in low-predation environments could indicate an organism's ability to devote energy into more complex social behaviors.Reddon et al. explore this brain variation in Trinidadian guppies (*Poecilia reticulata*). These populations experience both low predation in habitats prior to waterfalls, and high predation following waterfalls within the same river, making them a perfect system to study brain variation in relation to predation.
  * I will be replicating the linear model analyses performed in this study using the raw data provided by the authors via Dryad Digital Repository.
      - Analyses include data transformation (log transformed), linear model summary, and visualization of models and their residuals (assumptions check).
      - Data available as .xlsx file with two tabs (field, lab), which were separately saved as .csv files. Each contained information on brain mass, standard length, sex, and habitat type; for further details, see below.
      
      
## Data visualization
#### Getting the data:

```{r}
library(curl)

f_field <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisondavis/davis-allison-ADA-DATA-ANALYSIS-ASSIGNMENT/master/Reddon-etal.2018_data_field.csv")
d_f <- read.csv(f_field, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
d_f$X.U.FEFF.Fish <- NULL #this column gave a number identity to each fish 
  
  #to make the column names a little nicer:
colnames(d_f)[colnames(d_f)=="Predators..1...no..2...yes."] <- "Predation.1N.2Y"
colnames(d_f)[colnames(d_f)=="Sex..1...M..2...F."] <- "Sex.1M.2F"
colnames(d_f)[colnames(d_f)=="River..1...Marrianne..2...Aripo."] <- "Rivers.1M.2A"

head(d_f)

f_lab <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisondavis/davis-allison-ADA-DATA-ANALYSIS-ASSIGNMENT/master/Reddon-etal.2018_data_lab.csv")
d_l <- read.csv(f_lab, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
d_l$X.U.FEFF.Fish <- NULL #this column gave a number identity to each fish
d_l$X <- NULL #this column only existed in R, not sure what it corresponded to in excel file

  #to make the column names a little nicer:
colnames(d_l)[colnames(d_l)=="Predators..1.no..2.yes."] <- "Predation.1N.2Y"
colnames(d_l)[colnames(d_l)=="Sex..1...M..2...F."] <- "Sex.1M.2F"

head(d_l)

```

#### Basic data summary:
```{r}

#wild fishes
summary(d_f)

F_pred.p <- d_f[d_f$Predation.1N.2Y == "2", ]
sum(F_pred.p$Predation.1N.2Y) #number of fish in stress treatment (predator present)
F_pred.a <- d_f[d_f$Predation.1N.2Y == "1", ]
sum(F_pred.a$Predation.1N.2Y) #number of fish in calm treatment (predator absent)


#laboratory fishes
summary(d_l) #not sure why it says I have 74 NA's...I don't have any missing data for the fish and there's only 74
L_pred.p <- d_l[d_l$Predation.1N.2Y == "2", ]
sum(L_pred.p$Predation.1N.2Y) #number of fish in stress treatment (predator present)
L_pred.a <- d_l[d_l$Predation.1N.2Y == "1", ]
sum(L_pred.a$Predation.1N.2Y) #number of fish in calm treatment (predator absent)


```

#### Male vs Female body size comparison:
  * The paper compared male and female body size using a Welch's T Test. They found a significant difference in both wild and laboratory raised fishes, and therefore separated them in further analyses. 
    - paper values (mean SL±SE):
        * wild males = 12.77 ± 0.13 mm, wild females = 15.66 ± 0.30 mm; Welch’s t96.9 = 8.76, p < 0.001
        * laboratory males = 14.11 ± 0.15 mm, laboratory females = 28.26 ± 0.45 mm; Welch’s t29.19 = 29.7, p < 0.001

```{r}

#wild fishes
F_SL_m <- d_f$Standard.length..mm.[d_f$Sex.1M.2F=="1"]
F_SL_f <- d_f$Standard.length..mm.[d_f$Sex.1M.2F=="2"]
(F_SL_t <- t.test(x=F_SL_f, y=F_SL_m, mu=0, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)) #confirmed a significant difference between male and female standard length 
   
#lab fishes
L_SL_m <- d_l$Standard.length..mm.[d_l$Sex.1M.2F=="1"]
L_SL_f <- d_l$Standard.length..mm.[d_l$Sex.1M.2F=="2"]
(L_SL_t <- t.test(x=L_SL_f, y=L_SL_m, mu=0, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)) #confirmed a significant difference between male and female standard length 
    
```

#### Log transformations:
  * the paper log-transformed brain mass and standard length. They then mean-centered standard length. 
    - they don't report any specific values for this, but I will.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
#wild fishes
F_log_bm <- log(d_f$Brain.mass..mg.)
d_f <- mutate(d_f, F_brain=F_log_bm)
head(d_f)

F_log_sl <- log(d_f$Standard.length..mm.)
F_sl_mn <- mean(d_f$Standard.length..mm.)
F_sl_mc <- F_log_sl - log(F_sl_mn)
d_f <- mutate(d_f, F_SL=F_sl_mc)
head(d_f)

#lab fishes
L_log_bm <- log(d_l$Brain.mass..mg.)
d_l <- mutate(d_l, L_brain=L_log_bm)
head(d_l)

L_log_sl <- log(d_l$Standard.length..mm.)
L_sl_mn <- mean(d_l$Standard.length..mm.)
L_sl_mc <- L_log_sl - log(L_sl_mn)
d_l <- mutate(d_l, L_SL=L_sl_mc)
head(d_l)

```

## Analysis replication:
  * The paper investigates the relationship of brain mass and body size with predation exposure in both wild-caught and lab-raised fish. 
  * This relationship is determined using linear models, with standard length as a covariate. 
    - For field collections, river and river+predation were also included as factors.
  * Due to the significant difference in body size between sexes analyses are run separately for each sex.
  * Assumptions for linear models (homoscedasticity and normality) tested by creating QQ plots of residuals (shown in visualization section).

      - **Males, particularly lab-raised males, display normality whereas females stray from normality.**

## Conclusions

#### In accordance with Reddon et al., I conclude a significant effect of predation on brain mass of male, but not female, Trinidadian guppies.
  * Despite this agreement in p-Value, I was unable to derive matching estimate and standard error values for every linear model. I believe this inconsistancy stems from their method of estimate calculations. They say the following in each table caption: 
    
    *Estimates represent the difference in log- transformed brain mass between the level of a factor (identified in parenthesis) and the reference levels for categorical factors and are mean- centred for covariates. The reference levels were high predation and Aripo River.* [Lab tables did not include river reference level.]
      - I performed linear regressions reversing the reference levels (low and Marianne) to see if subtracting these estimates from original table estimates would create a matching value (calculations not shown); this did not give the desired effect.
      - Further explanation or clarity in writing could alleviate this problem.
